# Logistic Regression vs Neural Network on Iris Dataset

Project for ACM-VIT recruitments Round 2. 

The given problem was to prepare a logistic regression model and an Artificial Neural Network to classify features from the Iris dataset and explain in detail the various data-preprocessing techniques used, performance metrics for both the models and plot graphs for the same.

## This was created on Kaggle, the link of the notebook for running the code is:
